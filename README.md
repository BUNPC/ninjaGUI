# ninjaGUI
fNIRS data acquisition GUI

Beta version 1.0

Compatible with ninjaNIRS and fNIRS1000 (rev1) hardware.
Support for CW6 to be added in the future.
Built with MATLAB's app designer.
Due to the app designer being a new feature, some functions will only work with the newest versions of MATLAB. Version 2019a+ recommended.

Usage:
On the command line, type ninjaGUI(cfgname), where cfgname is a configuration file (.cfg) designed for the specific hardware to use.

Future versions will add a cfg file editor.
